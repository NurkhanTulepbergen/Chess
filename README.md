# Chess Game with AI

## Overview

This project is a Chess game application where players can play against an AI opponent. The AI is designed to provide a challenging and dynamic gameplay experience, suitable for players of all skill levels. The game includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction and is built using modern programming techniques.

## Features

Single-Player Mode: Play against an AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels.

Interactive GUI: Drag and drop chess pieces with smooth animations.

Move Validation: Ensures all moves comply with chess rules.

Undo Functionality: Allows players to undo moves.

Game Over Detection: Detects checkmate, stalemate, and draw conditions.

Customizable Board: Option to change the appearance of the chessboard and pieces.

## Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pygame for GUI and animations

chess for move validation and AI logic

## Installation

Prerequisites:

Python 3.8 or higher

pip package manager

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-ai
cd chess-ai

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the main script:

python main.py

The game window will open, and you can start playing.

## Game Controls

Start a New Game: Select New Game from the menu.

Make a Move: Click and drag a piece to the desired square.

Undo a Move: Click the Undo button.

Adjust AI Difficulty: Go to the settings menu and choose the desired difficulty level.

## AI Logic

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best moves. The depth of the search tree can be adjusted to change the difficulty level. At higher difficulties, the AI calculates several moves ahead, making it more challenging to defeat.

## Future Improvements

Multiplayer Mode: Support for online or local multiplayer.

Enhanced AI: Implementation of machine learning techniques for adaptive gameplay.

Mobile Version: Develop a mobile-friendly version for iOS and Android.

Game Analysis: Add a feature to analyze and provide feedback on completed games.
